  # `order:` + `numeric_order: true` hand closure_tree the `position` column --
  # it renumbers siblings itself on create, move and reorder, which is what the
  # admin's drag-to-reorder needs.

  # `dependent:` defaults to `:nullify`, which silently promotes a destroyed
  # page's children to roots -- both a cascade we don't want and a violation of
  # the one-root rule. `:restrict_with_error` disables it; `ensure_no_children`
  # below is what actually reports the refusal, in this app's wording.
